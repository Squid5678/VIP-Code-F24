Here's the PDDL goal specification for the given scenario:
```css
(define (goal SetUp)
  (:parameters
    (robo String)
  )
  (:init
    (in-place robo)
  )
  (:precondition
    (not empty? table_1)
    (not empty? table_2)
    (not empty? counter_1)
    (not empty? counter_2)
    (not empty? knife)
    (not empty? ladle)
    (not empty? smartphone)
  )
  (:action SetUp/SetUp
    :parameters
      (robo String)
    :precondition
      (and (in-place robo) (not empty? table_1) (not empty? table_2) (not empty? counter_1) (not empty? counter_2) (not empty? knife) (not empty? ladle) (not empty? smartphone))
    :effect
      (not (in-place robo))
  )
)
```
Note that this specification assumes that the objects and their properties are already defined in the domain ontology.
