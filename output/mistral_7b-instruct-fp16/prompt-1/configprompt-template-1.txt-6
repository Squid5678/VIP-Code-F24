The given text appears to be a list of objects and their properties, rather than a PDDL goal specification. Here is an example of a simple PDDL goal specification:
```yaml
(define (goal 1)
  ; The initial state
  (object on-table coffee-cup)
  
  ; The goal state
  (object not-on-table coffee-cup)
)
```
This goal specifies that the initial state is such that the coffee cup is on the table, and the goal state is such that the coffee cup is not on the table.
