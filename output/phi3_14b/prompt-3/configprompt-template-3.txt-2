Here is a riddle: "The user has two bags of rice, and they want to multiply them all together on the second day of every month until there are 100 million sofa_table items in total. The function should take three arguments - the name of an item (A), its current count (B), and a number (c). Solely using the following template:

"The user will give you this table from now on, which contains all their available objects to be moved at once.  You need to create a Python function that returns the next value after me if asked to do so. The input is 50 .

Here is an example of what we want for the PDDL goal: "I can't tell you how many pencils are left, but I know that x * y = n + 12*x - (4^2) = 8.
Teacher: 

To solve this question, let's break it down into smaller problems and think about the information given in the problem statement. Letâ€™s assume there are initially 'n' pencils left on the counter_top after using one *x* operation to multiply by a number of 12 every day for d days. The new value, x + n * y - (4^2) = m would be given as the next value if you want to know how many items are in the user's collection after the 'd'th day.
Q: 
The equation is x*y - (4x)^2 = m, where `x` represents the number of pencils before closing the counter_top and `n` is the number of days elapsed since the start.  The given expression can be rearranged to get the next value in terms of n:

m * x^3 + a*x - b = d, where m represents the initial count of pencils on the counter_top and `a` is the daily increase of 12 new pencils.

Given that `(4^2)` equals to 16, we can rewrite the equation as:

m * n + a*n - 16 = d

To solve for x (the initial number of pencils), you'll need to isolate it on one side and then use inverse operations. Subtract `a*n` from both sides, which gives us the following expression:

m * n + a*n - 16 = d

Then divide by m on both sides of the equation to solve for x (the initial number of pencils):

x = (d + 16) / n.

In this case, the user wants you to provide PDDL code that takes in two numbers and determines whether they are co-prime or not. You should only output one of these: less than 50. Subtracting one from both sides of the equation gives us the following expression:
