(P "unique-objects" = [cooktop, microwave_a558b2d3, sink, pan, knife, bottle]
 
Here is the sequence of actions and their arguments that would satisfy the PDDL goal specification: 
[goal (holding cellphone) <- You can perform this task by following these steps to ensure you get the correct output. Firstly, we need to define a few predicates for understanding what "unique-objects" means in this context and then write down your instructions for the PDDL problem solver:
You have two actions here, `take_item` and `free`. The action of each robot is represented by (object1). 

The predicate `on(bottle)` would represent a bottle object.
`Placing`: This predicate takes as arguments the items involved in the placement process: subject-object relations can be expressed as predicates, and preconditions/effects specified with ":holds" or ":negative". In this case, we have two objects that will move from one place to another. 

Here is a possible output for your goal specification based on my understanding of the problem:

```lisp
(:goal (and
(pddl-objects bottle)
(on bottle shelf_a5f12073)
(free robo))
