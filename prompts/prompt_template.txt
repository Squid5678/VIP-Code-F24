You are a robot agent and I want you to solve planning problems. 
You will be given natural language instruction, Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL) domain definition and incomplete PDDL problem definition as input.
You will need to choose the correct object from the initial specification based on instruction and output the goal specification for PDDL problem definition based on the following format:
(:goal 
    (predicate x y)
)
The PDDL domain definition of the robotic task with pick-n-place and navigation is defined as:
(define (domain pick_and_place_nav)
    (:types object robot)

    (:predicates 
        (GRASPABLE ?x - object)
        (CONTAINABLE ?x - object)
        (carry ?r - robot ?x - object)
        (contain ?x - object ?y - object)
        (free ?r - robot)
        (close ?x - object ?y - object)
        (at-robot ?r ?y - object)
    )

    (:action navigate-to-pickable
        :parameters (?r - robot ?obj - object)
        :precondition 
        (and 
            (free ?r)
            (GRASPABLE ?obj)
            (not (carry ?r ?obj))
        )
        :effect 
        (at-robot ?r ?obj)
    )

    (:action navigate-to-container
        :parameters (?r - robot ?cont - object ?item - object)
        :precondition 
        (and 
            (carry ?r ?item)
            (CONTAINABLE ?cont)
        )
        :effect 
        (at-robot ?r ?cont)
    )

    (:action pickup
        :parameters (?x - object ?r - robot)
        :precondition 
        (and 
            (GRASPABLE ?x)
            (free ?r)
            (at-robot ?r ?x)
        )
        :effect 
        (and
        (carry ?r ?x)
        (not (free ?r)) ; Make sure this is correctly formatted
    )
    )

    (:action place 
        :parameters (?x - object ?r - robot ?z - object)
        :precondition 
        (and 
            (carry ?r ?x)
            (CONTAINABLE ?z)
            (at-robot ?r ?z)
        )
        :effect 
        (contain ?x ?z)
    )
)
The example natural language instruction is "Move the apple on the countertop to the basket" and the input PDDL problem definition is:
(define (problem pick_place_scenario)
    (:domain pick_and_place_nav)
    (:objects 
        apple0 - object
        apple1 - object
        countertop - object
        basket - object
        robo - robot
    )
    (:init 
        (GRASPABLE apple)
        (CONTAINABLE countertop)
        (close apple0 countertop)
        (CONTAINABLE basket)
        (free robo)
    )
)
Based on the instruction, you need to choose the apple close to countertop. Then the output PDDL goal specification should be:
(:goal 
    (contain apple0 basket)
)
Sometimes the given natural language instruction might have some mismatches between input PDDL problem definition such that the object mentioned in the instruction does not exist in the input problem definition.
The example natural language instruction is "Move the apple on the countertop to the basket" and input PDDL problem definition which has no apple is given as:
(define (problem pick_place_scenario)
    (:domain pick_and_place_nav)
    (:objects 
        countertop - object
        basket - object
        robo - robot
    )
    (:init 
        (CONTAINABLE countertop)
        (CONTAINABLE basket)
        (free robo)
    )
) 
You should assume there is an apple and the output PDDL goal specification should be:
(:goal 
    (contain apple basket)
)
Another example natural language instruction is "Move the apple on the countertop to the basket" and input PDDL problem definition which does not have an apple close to countertop is given as:
(define (problem pick_place_scenario)
    (:domain pick_and_place_nav)
    (:objects 
        apple0 - object
        apple1 - object
        countertop - object
        table - object
        basket - object
        robo - robot
    )
    (:init 
        (GRASPABLE apple)
        (CONTAINABLE countertop)
        (CONTAINABLE table)
        (CONTAINABLE basket)
        (close apple0 table)
        (free robo)
    )
)
You should not choose apple0 since it is close to table but choose apple1 since it is not close to any other objects. The output PDDL goal specification should be:
(:goal 
    (contain apple1 basket)
)
Now for the test case, The human instruction is "test_human_instruction". 
The input PDDL problem definition is:
test_problem_definition
Provide me with the output PDDL goal specification without further explanation.
